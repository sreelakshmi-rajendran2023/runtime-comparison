# Go vs Python Efficiency Comparison

This repository compares the efficiency and run-time performance of Go and Python programming languages. It includes sample code files and an output screenshot for reference.

## Code Files

- [Python Code](./codes/runpy.py): Contains the Python code used for the comparison.
- [Go Code](./codes/rungo.go): Contains the Go code used for the comparison.

## Efficiency Comparison

The efficiency of Go and Python was evaluated by measuring the time taken for a specific task or operation. The code files mentioned above demonstrate the comparison scenario.

## Run-time Performance

To measure the run-time performance, the code was executed multiple times, and the average execution time was calculated. The results of the comparison are shown in the output screenshot below:

## How to Run

1. Download the code files from the [Python Code](./codes/runpy.py) and [Go Code](./codes/rungo.go) links.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. For Python versions up to 3, use the following command:
    ```
    python run_py.py
    ```
   For Python versions after 3, use the following command:
    ```
    python3 run_py.py
    ```
4. For Go, use the following command:
    ```
    go run run_go.go
    ```
   Make sure you have Go installed and properly configured on your system.

Please note that the commands mentioned above assume that you are running them from the same directory where the code files are located if not move to that directory using 'cd' command/
